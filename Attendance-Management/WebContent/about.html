            <h2><span class="primary-text">Who</span> We Are</h2>
            <p>Attendance management is the act of managing attendance or presence in a work setting to minimize loss due to employee downtime. ... Recently it has become possible to collect attendance data automatically through using real-time location systems, which also allow for cross-linking between attendance data and performance.</p>
            <p>Employees come to work, do their jobs, and then go home. Day after day. But, sometimes employees call off sick or come in late. They might ask you to rearrange their schedules to accommodate their personal lives. How can you possibly keep track of all the coming and going?

You need an attendance management system for employees.Attendance management is the way you keep track of employee hours. It is the system you use to document the time employees work and the time they take off. Attendance management can be done by recording employee hours on paper, using spreadsheets, punching time cards, or using online time and attendance software for your business.</p>

            <h2><span class="primary-text">What</span> We Do</h2>
            <p>Attendance management systems allow you to calculate the hours employees work accurately. This is especially beneficial if you have hourly employees. You need to be able to calculate the exact wages you owe employees. And, you need to know if you owe overtime wages to employees.</p>
            <p>Tracking employee time will let you know if employees are punctual. This only works if you require employees to document the exact time they come or go. You can see if an employee tends to show up late or skip out early.

Attendance management also lets you keep track of how many days off employees use. This is important if your business has a policy that lets employees use a certain number of sick or vacation days..</p>
